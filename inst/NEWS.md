**NEWS for the `GOglm` package**
========================================================
************************************

**Changes for version 0.2.0**
-----------------------------------
We used formal S3 methods in this version to facilitate further development of the package. We made more clear on what inputs are expected from the end-users to prepare the data frame and implement the `GOglm` method. Two generic functions are written: `summary` and `plot`, which can take one of the two new classes: `prepGOglm` and `goglm`, for brief summaries and plots of DE test and `GOglm` results. The vignette of this package is written in the README file. Please take a look at the development page for this package on [GitHub](https://github.com/gu-mi/GOglm).
